 ## 1. Compairing supervised Machine learning Methods
 
 ### 1.1 All about Boston Housing:
 If you have ever learned Data science or Machine learning this dataset needs no introduction. Most statisticians use it extensively either to learn ML algos or explain them. What makes this dataset unique is its complexity to predict the response variable. Most algorithms cannot accurately predict house prices. I have applied Linear Regression, Decision Trees,Ensemble methods Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, GAM, Neural Networks.
 
 ### 1.2 German Credit Scoring data:
 Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms over credit data of subjects to find the one that accurately predicts if an individual will be good candidate to loan or will tend to default.I have applied Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,Ensemble methods Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, GAM, Neural Networks.
 
 ### 1.3 Predicting occuracnce of Heart Disease
 Applying Machine Learning approaches(and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or  not, using one of the most used dataset â€” Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository
  
 ## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
 
 ### 2.1 Real estate Investment Analysis: 
 Worked on Airbnb and Zillow data from Kaggle to build a data product to find zip codes that are most profitable to invest in for short term rentals.
 
 ### 2.2 Iris Flower EDA
 An extensive EDA is performed for this very popular ML dataset. This helps understand the intricacies of data using different visualizations and the nuances between plots.
 
 ## 3. Statistical Modelling
 
 ### 3.1 Predict landing distance of commercial Flight
 To study what factors and how they would impact the landing distance of a commercial flight using Linear Regression.

 ### 3.2 Predict Risky and Long landing of commercial Flight
 To study what factors and how they would indicate a risky or long landing of a commercial flight. The response Binary (1,0) for Risky    and Long Landing

 ### 3.3 Multinomial Regression of FAA Data
 Multinomial regression is implemented on FAA Data. The continuous response is converted to categorical using cutoff values.
