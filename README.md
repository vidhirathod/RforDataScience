 ## 1.0 All about Boston Housing:
 If you have ever learned Data science or Machine learning this dataset needs no introduction. Most statisticians use it extensively either to learn ML algos or explain them. What makes this dataset unique is its complexity to predict the response variable. Most algorithms cannot accurately predict house prices. I have applied Linear Regression, Decision Trees,Ensemble methods Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, GAM, Neural Networks.
