# All about BOSTON HOUSING

If you have ever learned Data science or Machine learning this dataset needs no introduction. Most statisticians use it extensively either to learn ML algos or explain them. 
What makes this dataset unique is its complexity to predict the response variable. Most algorithms cannot accurately predict house prices. 

Lets try that.....!

Model: Regression Based

* Number of Instances: 506

* Number of Attributes: 13 continuous attributes (including "class"
                         attribute "MEDV"), 1 binary-valued attribute.
                         
Goal: Accuratly predict Housing prices in Boston area

Metric: Mean square error, Cross Validation error

Testing methodology: Divide the dataset into testing and Training,Model created on training used to predict testing data house prices
