# German Credit Scoring 

## Objective

The German credit score data are downloadable from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

Goal: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms over credit data of subjects to find the one that 
accurately predicts if an individual will be good candidate to loan or will tend to default

Metric: 
Loss : Asymmetric cost metric is used to calculate Loss.Ever false negative weighs 5 times to a False positive
Missclassification Rate: Incorrect Classifications/Total Classifications
Area under the curve(ROC): Area covered under a ROC Curve.

More priority of metrics is : Loss> MCR> AUC

Methodology:
Random sample a training data set that contains 70% of original data points. 
Perform exploratory data analysis. Find a best model for Credit Scoring data using logistic regression with AIC and BIC. 
Draw ROC curve, report the AUC, and present the misclassification rate table of your final model.

Test the out-of-sample performance.
